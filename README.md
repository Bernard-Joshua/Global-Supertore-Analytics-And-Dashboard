# Global-Supertore-Analytics-And-Dashboard

#Overview

The CFO of Global Superstore needs to have a good view of the global operations of the company, including sales, profit, and losses. Budgeting, investments, and targeted intervention of problem areas will depend on the CFO's ability to develop an understanding of which part/region performs well or otherwise. In order to support this, you have been tasked to conduct analyses on Global Superstore's transactions data and provide the CFO with two self-service dashboards.

**Task 1: Create**  a dynamic and interactive dashboard for the CFO of Global Superstore, including:

- the ability to focus on select years (either a 1-year period or multi-year period) for a specific country, or multiple countries
- the profit performance (as total profit) of each country where Global Superstore has a presence (or sold a product to); colour-code the visualisation to allow easy identification of countries with issues on profit performance
- a function that provides specific information on the dashboard when a specific country is selected, containing:
  - the regional manager
  - the region
  - the overall sales for the country
  - the overall profit for the country
- a graph to compare profit/loss on product sub-categories for the country and their grand total for the selected year
- a month-by-month indicator of how Global Superstore performs on total sales based on the country and selected years
- appropriate labels for key data points
- clear labels for all worksheet/dashboard/tiles to reflect the particular set of data it represents.

**Task 2: Produce**  a dynamic/interactive dashboard providing the following:

- The ability to change the focus on one specific region based on a Regional Manager from the list of current Regional Managers.
  - The title of the dashboard must reflect the specific region and the Regional Manager in focus.
  - All data and worksheets in the dashboard must reflect the data from the chosen region.
- A map visualisation showing the region in focus with:
  - clear labels on the name of states/provinces within the region
  - the average profit to be showcased (with appropriate labels and colours indicating different levels of performance) on the map for each of the states/provinces in the region.
- A summary of the number of returns and the sales value of the returned order on each of the countries in the region.
- Showcase side-by-side comparison between profit and sales for the product sub-categories in the region. The details need to be represented with an appropriate colour code to provide an indication of concerns based on profit (e.g. a poor profit performance should result in a certain colour for both the profit and sales).
- Key data points must be labelled appropriately.
- All worksheet/dashboard/tiles must be clearly labelled to reflect the particular set of data it represents.
